> Users receive bHERMES ERC-4626 shares proportional to their deposit, based on a conversion ratio that starts at a 1:1 ratio at version 2 launch and increases with inflation,** protecting voters from dilution.**
what does protecting voters from dilution means and how it can be achieved by increasing the conversion ratio ??


[05/31/2023 10:20] 0xbuzzlightyear
hey, so this is the same as a rebase. if 1% of the circulating supply increases, then 1% of the locked supply increases as well. Instead of having to claim the rebase, it happens through increasing the conversion ratio


[05/31/2023 10:23] 0xbuzzlightyear

bHermes. the conversion rate of hermes to bHermes grows with time. so it's equivalent to bHermes balance growing

Code4rena - ARCHIVE-Q2-2023 - maia-may30 [1110626768223739924].txt_Files/image-C1183.png


[05/31/2023 22:04] 0xbuzzlightyear
Thanks for pointing that out! it would be more correct to have min(100, 40+0.6). In a case where a user has more % of the bHermes Boost TotalSupply than he as % of the pool, that would come into effect and his balance would be used.
In that specific case, where the user has 100% of the pool, he would need to have more than 100% of bHermes Boost totalSupply to have more than 100.

On top of contracts where it is appropriate, we have references to where the logic was inspired/ported from. 
In the rewards folder you will find references to flywheel v2 from tribe dao:
`// Rewards logic inspired by Tribe DAO Contracts (flywheel-v2/src/FlywheelCore.sol)`
Here you can find the original contracts as well as other implementations or examples, like the one from Fuse (from rari capital):

gm, you will find the reports here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/tree/main/audits

We did address everything or acknowledged what was meant as business logic. You will find our remediation reviewed/acknowledged by zellic on the bottom of every finding, in which we almost always followed their recommendations, with links to commits for each audit's repo:
1st audit: https://github.com/Maia-DAO/maia-ecosystem-monorepo/commits/1-audit
2nd audit: https://github.com/Maia-DAO/maia-ecosystem-monorepo/commits/2-audit

We have made changes since then that are not on that repo. So please use the code4rena repo to make any POC.
But do want to add, if for some reason there was something that was missed and is not on the current code4rena repo it is a completely valid finding, the reports are not included in the Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

What is the reasoning behind calculating the cycles as the `next even divisor`?
```
// next cycle is always the next even divisor of the cycle length above current block timestamp.
uint32 currentCycle = (block.timestamp.toUint32() / gaugeCycleLength) * gaugeCycleLength;
```


[06/06/2023 19:35] 0xbuzzlightyear
It's truncating the value to get the current cycle. So it knows on what epoch (in our case week) it is

in which chains it will be deployed ?


[06/09/2023 10:22] 0xbuzzlightyear
arbitrum will have most (almost all) contracts, ulysses-omnichain branch contracts (other than arbitrumBranch) are supposed to be deployed in other chains, at launch will be: eth mainnet, optimism, polygon, bsc, metis and possibly ftm and avax


[06/09/2023 10:37] deadrosesxyz
is it supposed to be compatible with any chain?


[06/09/2023 11:19] 0xbuzzlightyear
The contracts for arbitrum, no. others should support any evm compatible chain.
many chains have their own limitations, but branch contracts are supposed to work on chains that support the opcodes used. for example some ZKs may need minor adjustments, namely in gas management constants.


[06/09/2023 17:54] aba1842

to be technical, if you find a missing NatSpec that was not reported in the automated findings you can say it. I don't really expect this would make such a difference for you but you can add it. (If I will submit QA and I do find a missing natspec that the bot missed (rare cases) then I will submit it, for example)

Most likely we will just setup our own off-chain component, since it isn't something that needs to be instant. it's cheaper this way. but we can setup "proper" automation for it, like chainlink keepers

there are lot of entry points in the system. I started with the `rewards` section and continued from there. There are also a lot of entry points per component/sub-protocols. I think Thalos is the most isolated, haven't gotten to it yet and Ulysses is probably the most complex part, judging by the video lengths üòÑ

hey @0xbuzzlightyear 
What is the difference or relation between `votes` and `weight` in the `bHermesGauges` token
And also, what is the `weight` used for?


[06/17/2023 09:41] 0xbuzzlightyear
Weight is for voting towards gauges, votes is the balance a user can use to vote towards gauges.
Votes come from ERC20MultiVotes that ERC20Gauges extends, where a user needs to delegate to itself for example before allocating weights to gauges


[06/17/2023 11:16] dontonka
why is this possible todo (create with the same owner) and what is the requirement to support this behavior?
```
    function testCreateBoostAggregatorSameOwner(address owner) public {
        mockUniswapV3Staker();
        hevm.assume(owner != address(0));

        assertEq(factory.getBoostAggregators().length, 1);

        factory.createBoostAggregator(owner);
        factory.createBoostAggregator(owner);

        assertEq(factory.getBoostAggregators().length, 3);
    }
```


[06/17/2023 11:33] 0xbuzzlightyear
Anyone can create any number of BoostAggregators, this is because you can only have 1 boosted NFT per pool per address. So if you want to have two boosted positions and split your boost between them, you can use two EOAs or create 1/2 boost aggregators


[06/17/2023 11:41] dontonka
alright, but this would be using multiple boost for the same EOA correct?


[06/17/2023 11:43] 0xbuzzlightyear
Yes. just want to clarify EOA was an example it's the same for any address.

@0xBugsy @0xbuzzlightyear could you clarify the relation between local, global and underlying tokens in ulysses-omnichain?


[06/19/2023 21:43] 0xbugsy (pinned)
Hey! Ulysses Omnichain Virtualized Liquidity System has 3 token addresses minimum per token: 

- 1 underlying address ( let's imagine OP token from Optimism) 
- 1 global address (hOP in Arbitrum Root environment used in UniswapV3, Talos and Ulysses AMM for example)
- 1 localHToken address in its origin chain so you can use the receipt of 1 OP deposited in OP's branch Port in OP for composability purposes (this is 100% opt-in). N  of these local hTokens can also be created 1 for each connected chain - 2 (the token origin chain and the root chain). These also serve the same purpose of being a receipt for a port deposit this time for a port in a different chain. (Example hOP in Eth mainnet and hOP in FTM)

Hey @0xBugsy @light 
How can users get hTokens?

My understanding regarding depositing and briding is that the user sends both tokens, the `hToken` and the `underlyingToken`, so, how can users get those hTokens? (Or maybe I misunderstood this logic....)


[06/20/2023 05:00] __melonwater
user receive hToken at root chain. I think they can choose to deposit underlying OR hToken at branch chain

thanks for the comprehensive reply, a follow up question, you've written
> These also serve the same purpose of being a receipt for a port deposit this time for a port in a different chain. (Example hOP in Eth mainnet and hOP in FTM)
Does it mean:
1. you bridge 1 OP to mainnet, you recive 1 `localHToken` for mainnet `hOP` 
2. can you bridge ARB `hOP` to mainnet or FTM? If so, is it intended way to use the system?
3. can you bridge the `localHToken` to other chain? If so, would it make sense?

if it's about ulysses-omnichain @0xBugsy will be able to help you and explain it better


[06/20/2023 12:13] 0xbugsy
Hey, any underlying asset deposited in a port (like OP in OP chain in my other example) corresponds to 1 hToken and after any interaction you can choose to withdraw assets from the platform afterwards as underlying assets or stay in hTokens (deposit receipts). So upon entry into the system you will always use underlying assets unless you have previously interacted and requested token settlement/clearance in hTokens or acquired hTokens in alternative ways (in a dex for example)


[06/20/2023 12:21] 0xbugsy
Gm, clearing hTokens to a branch chain is fully opt-in and is possible solely for composability purposes, with the exception of our ecosystem tokens (Hermes and Maia) that are always hTokens so they can be bridged around in a burn-and-mint dynamic (you can see the addition of these tokens to the system here https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/54a45beb1428d85999da3f721f923cbf36ee3d35/src/ulysses-omnichain/RootPort.sol#L491). 
To give further context on hToken addition see `CoreRootRouter` (https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/54a45beb1428d85999da3f721f923cbf36ee3d35/src/ulysses-omnichain/CoreRootRouter.sol)

So no rewards are accrued from the mock contract and FlyWheelRewardsInstant only accrues 10 ether of rewardToken for the strategy.


[06/26/2023 14:21] UCh#4429
Thanks mate. So the initial 10 ether rewardToken still considered for user2 accrual and stopped further accrual from mock booster or strategy?


[06/26/2023 14:53] 0xbuzzlightyear
exactly, user1 has 25% of the supply, so he will accrue 2.5 ether and then user2 has 75% of the supply and no new rewards are accrued by the strategy so he will accrue 7.5 ether

As guidelines we have this https://code4rena.notion.site/Analyses-Guidelines-and-FAQ-2808a71e08e44c81a985527194f5f118 (the Questions to answer in your analysis, Advanced part)

We don't want to dissuade anyone into submitting any kind of analyses. just want to say for anyone reading this, if you are stuck this might help, but this is just our opinion atm on what we think anyone in our situation would want. We are not the judges, but even if we were, would be unfair to favor anyone who would follow this.

Will try to give a couple of examples on each "Advanced" point from the analysis guideline:

1. Analysis of the codebase (What's unique? What's using existing patterns?)
Anything that would either improve our codebase or documentation about it is deeply appreciated. Identifying pain points can also be very helpful, even if you don't have a specific solution to it, can be an issue with the architecture itself, with naming (contracts, functions, variables) or lacking on the comment/documentation side. So letting us know of anything you didn't think it was perfect will always be appreciated.
Everyone loves solutions, but don't worry if you don't have one, we prefer to know any kind of issues regardless of the solutions provided. You can provide 0 or multiple solutions if you are on the fence between them or just to show your thought process.

2. Architecture feedback
In terms of documenting/explaining something, anything is appreciated, from summaries, sketches, diagrams, pseudo-code, formulas, etc. Feel free to choose what you think it's best for each situation, but generally, any extra resources are always welcomed.

3. Centralization risks
Same as others, having this thoroughly explained is a huge plus. Not sure if this is in this section or the next, but potential governance attack vectors.

4. Systemic risks
Finding sensitive points in the codebase is extremely important. as well as identifying the effects of these, like chain availability, messaging layer availability, unexpected MEV opportunities, governance risks, etc.

5. Other recommendations
Again, if it will help improve or understand the codebase, it is very welcomed. An example that might not apply to this audit due to it's size but I would say is definitely useful, is making a threat model. we do have a threat model made by zellic but it is not complete, feel free to give it a look in `/threat-model`.

You will probably find nice things to add by looking at third party audit reports from firms or solo auditors, even if not from this space.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Attention: Teams submitting Analyses**

A technical issue is preventing some **warden teams** from submitting **Analysis reports**. Given we are fast approaching this audit's final submission deadline,  Team Analyses ONLY may be submitted as follows: 

1. Create a secret Gist containing your team's Analysis in Markdown (.md)
2. While logged in to your C4 account, submit a help desk request (https://code4rena.com/help) with the subject "Team Analysis for Maia"
3. Paste the link to your secret Gist in the Description field. 

You must still submit this by the deadline, and we are not able to accept other submission types this way.

[07/15/2023 14:47] 0xbuzzlightyear
hey, thx for the bump it is very unfortunate for a lot of reasons, but on the bright side due to the events happening on the week code4rena started we started immediately migrating to layerzero so we already have that done. So these last events didn't really affect us

{Reactions}
ü•≤ 

[07/15/2023 14:50] 0xbuzzlightyear
This has no impact on the contest however, especially no impact for wardens. Because layzero handles all gas management unlike anycall, there may be some findings which we just acknowledge and don't address since that part of the code will be deprecated. Other than that, there is no kind of impact
We were planning on addressing them even with the migration to L0, but if there is no more mpc or anycall, doesn't make sense

TapiocaDao may have more findings than MaiaDao


[08/02/2023 11:03] block_chomper
not gonna lie I'm bitterly dissapointed with 778 USD for a months work and 3 confirmed highs and one medium - guess they must have been duplicated the shit out of


[08/02/2023 11:03] block_chomper
thought the config error we found with anyCall was pretty rare but obviously not!


[08/02/2023 11:04] block_chomper
would have been good to be backstage and see the judging process but hopefully in the future this will be possible


[08/02/2023 11:26] alexxander
It was vast codebase 12k sloc naturally it is expected that there will be a lot of issues which ultimately increased the shares so duped highs didn‚Äôt earn as much, however, apart from @xuwinnie who killed it with 14 highs, the awards are well distributed, I think there was a lot of opportunity to find unique highs & meds.

Guys, please be aware of 'Address Poisoning' attack vectors.
After receiving my payout from this contest, my address was subject of this type of attack. There are several versions of this attack, be aware of them.

Poisoning how?

<https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/11967455819035-Address-poisoning-scams>


[08/03/2023 16:10] thekmj
Basically if you `transfer` some USDC from "your address" to "0xsomething", then anyone else can `transferFrom` 0 USDC from "your address" to "0xsometh1ng"


[08/03/2023 16:11] thekmj
Tx doesn't revert, event is still emitted, and shows up on block explorer


[08/03/2023 16:11] thekmj
The only effect is that the next time you transfer funds, you might copy paste the wrong address "0xsometh1ng" instead of your "0xsomething", since on the explorer it only shows "0xso..ng"


[08/03/2023 16:12] thekmj
Double check your target address completely each time before transferring anything and you're fine
