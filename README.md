## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

Automated findings output for the audit can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/itsmetechjay/09ae039958715d881a47209f74af1b7c) within 24 hours of audit opening.

*Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in the automated findings output is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards.*

There are a couple of known issues that are intended and not in scope for this audit:
- Rebases and Fee-On-Transfer tokens are not supported. 
- Ulysses AMM (Ulysses Pools and Ulysses Tokens) only supports tokens with 18 decimals, but Ulysses Omnichain accounting supports tokens with any decimals and converts them to 18 decimals.
- There are contracts that allow to renounce ownership and do not override renounceOwnership function from `solady` library.
- In ERC20MultiVotes, the delegateBySig uses ecrecover to allow someone to delegate their votes by signing off-chain. Using ecrecover can return a random signer. This can lead to the random address being delegated to the supplied delegatee, but because delegations need to be larger than zero this is not seen as a security issue. GovernorBravoDelegate also uses this, but it is not in scope.
- Our protocol has permissionless factories where anyonce can create with poison erc20 tokens or add poison erc20 tokens. While contracts generated by these are not in scope, __if it does affect other contracts or other balances, it is in scope.__

# Overview

Maia DAO V2 Ecossytem docs that explains the business logic and technical references, can be found [here](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/). Docs are split into 4 protocols, in which you will find relevant information about how each of these protocols work in the system.

Recognizing that some wardens may prefer multimedia resources, we've integrated a comprehensive video tutorial into our docs, repo, and code. Designed as an alternative to traditional text-based materials, these videos offer a direct visual approach to system comprehension. You can access these resources on our [notion page here](https://maiaeco.notion.site/Code4rena-Code-Overview-3f455e66c457427ab3650a73a614641c).

Maia DAO Ecosystem is made to be a significant increase in capital efficiency and utility for the Maia DAO community from the V1 ecosystem. The V2 ecosystem is made up of 4 protocols: Hermes, Maia, Talos and Ulysses.

Previous Audits by Zellic can be found in the [audits](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/tree/main/audits) folder. There are two audits, each for different parts of the codebase:
 - [Rewards System](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/tree/main/audits/Maia%20DAO%20February%202023%20-%20Zellic%20Audit%20Report.pdf)
 - [Ulysses Protocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/tree/main/audits/Ulysses%20Protocol%20May%202023%20-%20Zellic%20Audit%20Report.pdf)

### Hermes

[Hermes](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/protocols/Hermes/introduction) provides significant improvements over V1, which is a soldily fork. There are three ideas behind this model:
- Lockers direct emissions to gauges and receive the revenue of each gauge they vote for, proportional to the amount of votes for that gauge
- Lockers can boost their liquidity farming rewards from gauges by up to 2.5x
- Lockers receive rebases weekly proportional to inflation

One of the improvements made is that instead of veNFTs that are locked for 4 years, every lock is made permanent. Claiming rebases was also substituted with a deposit only ERC4626 tokenized vault, which instead of claiming rebases, the burn (permanent lock) rate is increased. This allows users only to vote once and remove unecessary weekly tasks to optimize their funds.

Hermes also introduced a new gauge system, that accepts any kind of yield. The first gauges to be deployed are the Uniswap V3 gauges, which allow users to stake their NFTs and receive rewards. The gauges also allow users to boost their rewards up to 2.5x.

### Maia

[Maia](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/protocols/introduction) is the first implementation of the Partner bHermes Vault. It allows users to stake their Maia converting it to vMaia and receive two of the three bHermes utilities deposited in the vault. The utilities are: weight and governance. The third utility is boost, which is not claimable by users, but instead used by Maia's Treasury to host a boost aggregator with Talos Positions to enable further accumulation of hermes.

### Talos

[Talos](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/protocols/Talos/introduction) is decentralized Uniswap V3 Liquidity Management protocol. It allows anyone to create and manage new LPs. These LPs always start 50/50 and if they have a manager, it can call two strategies: rebalancing and reranging. Talos LPs are Uni V3 NFT wrappers, while this is less gas efficient, it allows for easier integrations with other protocols, like staking in Uniswap V3 gauges.

Staked Talos Positions need to be attached to a boost aggregator, anyone can deploy one using Boost Aggregator Factory. This allows users to pool together and share the same boost.

### Ulysses

[Ulysses](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/protocols/Ulysses/introduction) is devided in two separate concepts: Virtualized and Unified Liquidity. Virtualized liquidity is made possible by using anycall v7 as our messaging layer and means that an asset deposited from a specific chain, is recognized as a different asset from the "same" asset but from a different chain (ex: arb ETH is different from mainnet ETH). Unified Liquidity then unifies these tokens using a stableswap AMM and then depositing them in a Unified Liquidity Token, which is a Multi-Asset ERC4626 tokenized vault. This allows users to deposit any asset from any chain and receive a 1:1 representation of the underlying assets. These Unified Liquidity Tokens can then be used in any other protocol, like Uniswap v3.

## Areas of Concern

While this audit has the whole V2 ecosytem in scope, there are specific concerns that we would like to highlight for the wardens to pay special attention to. These are:
- omnichain accounting.
- omnichain gas management.
- ulysses AMM and token accounting
- proper reward/bribe management
- brick funds in uniswap v3 staker
- try to game/brick/steal funds from talos positions

# Additional Context

### Uniswap v3 Gauges

Hermes V2 is based on solidly's ve(3,3), in order to keep the same logic for the voting and boosting power of the users, was added a new logic for the calculation of the boosted rewards for the uniswapV3 positions, which is based on the seconds per liquidty in active range to calculate rewards of the uniswapV3Staker. It is based on the original [UniswapV3Staker logic](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/periphery/staker/Design#getrewardinfo).

The original Uniswap V3 Staker awards positons based on the difference between snapshotCumulativesInside when staked vs when unstaked times the liquidity of the position. By doing this, we get how much liquidity seconds each position is awarded. In Hermes V2 case, all of hermes incentives have a duration of 1 week, so we can calculate the liquidity seconds per week for each position, 1 week being the maximum.

The original curve logic behind calculating boosted rewards for uniswapV3 positions is based on the following formula, found [here, in docs](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/protocols/Hermes/overview/tokenomics/utility-tokens/bhermes-boost):

$Rewards Received = min(UserLiquidity,(40\%*UserLiquidity)+(60\%*TotalLiquidity*UserBoostBalance/BoostTotal))$

In order to calculate the boosted rewards for the uniswapV3 positions, we have used the following formula:

$Rewards Received = min(Position Rewards, Position Rewards * 40\% + (Total Rewards For Duration Staked * User bHERMES / Total bHERMES Supply) * 60\%)$

More information on Uniswap V3 Gauges and how boost calculation is made, can be found [here, in docs](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/protocols/Hermes/overview/gauges/uni-v3#calculating-boost).

### Ulysses Pools AMM - Delta Algorithm

The Ulysses Pools AMM is an adaptation of the Delta Algorithm put forh by LayerZero, the original paper can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gf3606jedromp61/Delta-Solving.The.Bridging-Trilemma.pdf?dl=0).

In short, Ulysses Pools AMM is a stableswap AMM that allows for the creation of N to N pools with different weights, and the ability to change the weights of the pools after creation. In order to make sure no pools is ever in deficit, only new pools can be added to exisitng pools, can never be removed.

Because of all of Ulysses pools are in the same network (Arbitrum), we can avoid the need to keep credits from each pool, unlike the original Delta Algorithm. This allows us to simplify the logic of the algorithm.

Adapted from: [Figure 4](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gf3606jedromp61/Ulysses-Solving.The.Bridging-Trilemma.pdf?dl=0), this is the pseudocode for the algorithm:
```
Input: Transaction amount t, destination LP ID d
 # On the source LP:
 1: aₛ ← aₛ + t
 2: bₛ,𝒹 ← bₛ,𝒹 − t
 3: for x != s do
 4:     diffₛ,ₓ ← max(0, lpₛ * wₛ,ₓ − lkbₓ,ₛ)
 5: end for
 6: Total ← ∑ₓ diffₛ,ₓ
 7: for x != s do
 8:     diffₛ,ₓ ← min(Total, t) * diffₛ,ₓ / Total
 9: end for
 10: t′ ← t - min(Total, t)
 11: for ∀x do
 12:     bₛ,ₓ ← bₛ,ₓ + diffₛ,ₓ + t′ * wₛ,ₓ
 13: end for
 14: msg = (t)
 15: Send msg to LP d

 # On the destination LP:
 16: Receive (t) from a source LP
 17: if bₛ,𝒹 < t then
 18:     Reject the transfer
 19: end if
 20: a𝒹 ← a𝒹 − t
 21: bₛ,𝒹 ← bₛ,𝒹 − t
```

### Ulysses Pools AMM - Rebalancing Fees

Renalancing fees are a way to incentivize users to rebalance Ulysses Pools. The fees are calculated based on the difference between the current bandwidth (balance dedicated to another pool) of the pool and the target bandwidth (weight * totalsupply) of the pool. More info can be found [here, in docs](https://v2-docs.maiadao.io/protocols/Ulysses/overview/unified-liquidity/fees#rebalancing-fees). The fees are calculated as follows:


| Rebalancing Fee                                            | Condition                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 0                                                          | $b−t \leq \delta _1B$                  |
| $\frac{\lambda_1}{(\delta_1−\delta_2)B}(\delta_1 B−b+t)$   | $\delta _2B \leq b−t \lt \delta _1B$   |
| $\lambda_1+\frac{\lambda_2}{\delta_2B}(\delta_2B−b+t)$     | $b−t \lt \delta _2 B$                  |

Fee Parameters:

| Parameter      | Value  |
|----------------|--------|
| $\lambda_1$   | 0.40%  |
| $\lambda_2$   | 99.60% |
| $\delta_1$    | 60%    |
| $\delta_2$    | 5%     |

Because the lambda fee parameters in contract are divided by 2, the actual values used in the contract are:

| Parameter      | Value  |
|----------------|--------|
| $\lambda_1$   | 0.20%  |
| $\lambda_2$   | 49.80% |
| $\delta_1$    | 60%    |
| $\delta_2$    | 5%     |

```
The fee is calculated as a trapezium with a base of width and a height of height
       The formula for the area of a trapezium is (a + b) * h / 2

                              bandwidth

         max width = upper bound 2
         amount = upper bound 2 - bandwidth

           h = amount
           a = fee1 + (fee2 * amount / max width)
           b = fee1

           fee = (a + b) * h / 2
               = (fee1 + fee1 + (fee2 * amount / max width)) * amount / 2
               = ((fee1 * 2) + (fee2 * amount / max width)) * amount / 2

         Because lambda1 = fee1 / 2 and lambda2 = fee2 / 2

         fee = ((fee1 * 2) + (fee2 * amount / max width)) * amount / 2
             = (lambda1 * 2 * amount) + (lambda2 * amount * amount) / max width
             = amount * ((lambda1 * 2) + (lambda2 * amount / max width))


When offset (b) is 0, the trapezium is equivalent to a triangle:
       The formula for the area of a triangle is a * h / 2

                                  |
                              bandwidth

         max width = upper bound 1 - upper bound 2
         amount = upper bound 1 - bandwidth

           h = amount
           a = fee1 * amount / max width
           b = 0

           fee = (a + b) * h / 2
               = fee1 * amount * amount / (2 * max width)

         Because lambda1 = fee1 / 2

         fee = fee1 * amount * amount / (2 * max width)
             = lambda2 * amount * amount / max width

### Ulysses Omnichain Liquidity - AnycallV7 integration

Ulysses Omnichain Liquidity System uses AnycallV7 (https://github.com/anyswap/multichain-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/anycall/v7) for cross-chain messaging, it is integrated using the Pay on Destination flag (`0x06`), meaning execution gas fees are credited to the recipient contract (Bridge Agent) deducting the gas spent from this contract's `executionBudget` kept in the AnycallConfig contract (https://docs.multichain.org/developer-guide/anycall-v7/estimate-fee-pay-fees-on-destination-chain)

# Tests

Here is an example of a full script to run the first time you build the contracts in Linux:
```bash
forge install
forge build
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install pycryptodome
python3 init_code_hash.py
deactivate
forge test --gas-report
forge snapshot --diff
```

Here is an example of a full script to run the first time you build the contracts in Windows:
This script is not tested, if you have any issues, please refer to [pycruptodome's documentation](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/installation.html#windows-from-sources) or try to hash Uniswap V3 Pool's bytecode through [another method](#update-init_code_hash-in-pooladdress).
```bash
forge install
forge build
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install pycryptodome --no-binary :all:
python init_code_hash.py
deactivate
forge test --gas-report
forge snapshot --diff
```

Default gas prixe is 10,000, but you can change it by adding `--gas-price <gas price>` to the command or by setting the `gas_price` property in the [foundry.toml](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/tree/main/foundry.toml) file.

Tests don't compile with --via-ir, but contracts do and will be deployed with --via-ir. Compilation settings that will be used are in [hardhat.config.ts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/tree/main/hardhat.config.ts).

### Install and First Build

Install libraries using forge and compile contracts.
```bash
forge install
forge build
```

### Update INIT_CODE_HASH in PoolAddress

Update [PoolAddress.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/tree/main/lib/v3-periphery/contracts/libraries/PoolAddress.sol) with correct INIT_CODE_HASH according to latest build. This has to be run everytime UniswapV3Pool is compiled.

The following example runs a scirpt using a python virtual environment in Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install pycryptodome
python3 init_code_hash.py
deactivate
```

If you wish, you can install the python dependencies globally and run the script:
```bash
pip3 install pycryptodome
python3 init_code_hash.py
```

The following example runs a scirpt using a python virtual environment in Windows:
This script is not tested, if you have any issues, please refer to [pycruptodome's documentation](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/installation.html#windows-from-sources) or try to hash Uniswap V3 Pool's bytecode through the method below.
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install pycryptodome --no-binary :all:
python init_code_hash.py
deactivate
```

If you wish to do this manually or are having issues with the previous scripts. Then please follow these steps (after building at least once):
- Get the bytecode from `out/UniswapV3Pool.sol/UniswapV3Pool.json`. To do this, head over to the file and get the bytecode from the "bytecode" and then "object" field.
- Copy this bytecode and use any tool to hash it using keccak-256 function. For example this [tool](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html), but please remember to remove the first two characters "0x" and __select input type to "hex"__ (default is string).

### Build PoolAddress and Run Tests

Default gas prixe is 10,000, but you can change it by adding `--gas-price <gas price>` to the command or by setting the `gas_price` property in the [foundry.toml](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/tree/main/foundry.toml) file.

Compile contracts again to update PoolAddress.sol bytecode and run tests.
```bash
forge test --gas-report
```

Compile contracts again to update PoolAddress.sol bytecode and check snapshot differece.
```bash
forge snapshot --diff
```

## Slither

If you encounter any issues, please update slither to [0.9.3](https://github.com/crytic/slither/releases/tag/0.9.3), the latest version at the moment.

To run [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) from root, please specify the src directory.
```bash
slither "./src/*"
```

We have a [slither config](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/tree/main/slither.config.json) file that turns on optimization and adds forge remappings.
